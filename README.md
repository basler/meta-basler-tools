OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Basler tools
=============================================

This layer contains SoC independent tools to operate Basler cameras,
namely pylon and pypylon.

To operate U2V and GigE cameras this is the only layer you need.

For the dart BCON for Mipi cameras you need a SoC specific support layer.
