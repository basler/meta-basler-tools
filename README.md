OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Basler tools
=========================================

This layer contains SoC independent tools to operate Basler cameras,
namely pylon and pypylon.

To operate U3V and GigE cameras this is the only layer that is needed.

For the dart BCON for Mipi cameras an additional SoC specific support layer is 
needed.
