of the SOFTWARE which constitutes non-proprietary BASLER software or software
provided under Open source license by third parties ("third-party
software"), is licensed to you subject to the terms and conditions of the
software license agreement accompanying such third-party software. Use of the
third-party software by you shall be governed entirely by the terms and
conditions of such license. You can find the license terms and conditions in
the file "pylon Third-Party Licenses.html" or contact BASLER support. 
BASLER software includes some open source software source code that may be used 
and modified by anyone and everyone, provided they, in turn, make it available to 
everyone else with the same licensing agreement. Please contact BASLER support for 
the original source code of components licensed under Open source licenses.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

BASLER grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
SOFTWARE provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT.

3. PERMITTED USE OF THE SOFTWARE

You may install and use the SOFTWARE as whole or in parts (single files, e.g. DLLs
etc.) on an unlimited number of computers. You may solely use the SOFTWARE for
the purpose to operate a BASLER camera product.

4. TRANSFER

You may not rent, lease, sub-license, or lend the
SOFTWARE or any portions thereof to others, except as expressly granted in this
section 4. You may transfer the SOFTWARE in whole or in parts (single files,
e.g. DLLs etc.) to another individual/entity provided that the transferee
accepts the terms of this AGREEMENT.

5. RESTRICTIONS

You may not copy or use the SOFTWARE except
as set forth in this AGREEMENT. You may not remove any proprietary notices or
labels on the SOFTWARE; any copies that you are permitted to make pursuant to
this Agreement must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices
that appear on and in the SOFTWARE.

6. LIMITATION ON REVERSE ENGINEERING

You agree not to modify, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the
SOFTWARE or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the SOFTWARE or
algorithms contained therein or create any derivative works from the SOFTWARE,
except as expressly provided in this AGREEMENT.

7. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

All intellectual property rights in the SOFTWARE are owned by BASLER 
or its suppliers and are protected by copyright laws and international copyright 
treaties. You shall not remove any product identification, copyright notices or
proprietary restrictions from the SOFTWARE.

8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASLER AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND OF LACK OF VIRUSES ALL WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE
PRODUCT. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of implied warranties
or limitations on the duration of implied warranties, so the above disclaimer
may not apply to you in its entirety.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BASLER OR ITS SUPPLIERS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS OR
CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL
INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF BASLER OR ANY SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you.

10. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This AGREEMENT shall be considered to have been entered into and
construed in accordance with the laws of Germany. For all controversies between
the parties or claims based on this AGREEMENT the District Court Hamburg shall
have jurisdiction. Failure by either party to enforce any term of this
AGREEMENT shall not be deemed to be a waiver of future enforcement of that term
or any other term. You agree that this AGREEMENT shall be enforceable in a
court of equity and acknowledges that a breach by you of the terms of this
AGREEMENT may not be adequately remedied by an award of damages and that BASLER
shall therefore be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief in the
event of such breach. You further agree that the election by BASLER to seek
equitable relief shall not preclude it from also seeking relief at law.

11. GENERAL

This AGREEMENT is the complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties and supersedes all
prior agreements and communications with respect to the subject matter. This
AGREEMENT shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns and cannot be modified except by a
writing signed by both parties. If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held
invalid, the offending clause will be modified so as to be enforceable and, as
modified, shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of this AGREEMENT will
continue in full force and effect.
